MissingOutputException in line 32 of /home/liyubing/analysis/7_snakemake/hisat-deseq-go-kegg/pro1/rules/snp.smk:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
outData/snp/Annotation/EV.SnpEff.html
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job snpEff since they might be corrupted:
outData/snp/Annotation/EV.SnpEff.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
