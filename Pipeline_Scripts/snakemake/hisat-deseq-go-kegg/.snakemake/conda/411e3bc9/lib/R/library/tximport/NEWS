CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.8
------------------------

    o Support for inferential replicates written
      by Rob Patro! Works for Salmon, Sailfish 
      and kallisto. See details in ?tximport.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.6
------------------------

    o Now, 'countsFromAbundance' not ignored when txOut=TRUE.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.4
------------------------

    o Support for kallisto HDF5 files thanks to
      Andrew Parker Morgan and Ryan C Thompson

    o Removing 'reader' argument, leaving only
      'importer' argument. In addition, read_tsv
      will be used by default if readr package is
      installed.

    o Messages from the importing function are
      captured to avoid screen clutter.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0
-------------------------

    o Preparing package for Bioconductor submission.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.19
-------------------------

    o Added `summarizeToGene` which breaks out the gene-level
      summary step, so it can be run by users on lists of
      transcript-level matrices produced by `tximport` with
      `txOut=TRUE`.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.18
=========================

    o Changed argument `gene2tx` to `tx2gene`.
      This order is more intuitive: linking transcripts to genes,
      and matches the `geneMap` argument of Salmon and Sailfish.
