This package is based on public domain S and FORTRAN code for AVAS by 
Tibshirani, and on FORTRAN code for ACE from Statlib, written by Spector
and Friedman.

The FORTRAN code has been edited to use double precision, for
compatibility with R, and the R code and documentation for ace() have been
added by Thomas Lumley, based on that for avas().
