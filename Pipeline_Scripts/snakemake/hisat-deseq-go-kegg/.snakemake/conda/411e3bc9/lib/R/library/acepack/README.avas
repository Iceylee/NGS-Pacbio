This archive contains new S code for avas (additivity and variance
stabilization). It is used to estimate transformations for regression.
It is officially a public domain product.
 
To use it you need to be able to dynamically load fortran 
code.
To get it going:

-compile rlsmo.f and avas.r
-source the file avas.s in S
- type help(avas) to see how to use it


This is not thoroughly tested code and  I'd appreciate feedback.
