###1.COUNT
SELECT COUNT(breed)
FROM dogs

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT breed)
  FROM dogs

#When a column is included in the parentheses, null values are automatically ignored.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Dog_Guid)
  FROM complete_tests

#计算行数
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM dogs;

SELECT COUNT(exclude)
FROM dogs;
#后者的结果比前者少很多，是因为，当列名放在count函数中时，null 值被忽略了。而星号情况，null值会记入总数。

#计数exclude列有多少null值
SELECT SUM(ISNULL(exclude))
FROM dogs


###2.AVG MIN MAX
SELECT test_name, 
AVG(rating) AS AVG_Rating, 
MIN(rating) AS MIN_Rating, 
MAX(rating) AS MAX_Rating
FROM reviews

###3.timestampdiff
#单位分钟，若时长小于1min，输出0
SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_time,end_time) as Duration
FROM exam_answers
LIMIT 100

#新计算的列，不是原表的列，需要多次引用
SELECT COUNT(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_time,end_time))
FROM exam_answers
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_time,end_time)<0


##---------MySQL_Ex5:Breaking Summaries into Groups--------------##
#The GROUP BY clause comes after the WHERE clause, but before ORDER BY or LIMIT
SELECT test_name, AVG(rating) AS AVG_Rating
FROM reviews
GROUP BY test_name
 #注意：group by的列必须包含在SELECT中（testname）


SELECT test_name, MONTH(created_at) AS Month, COUNT(created_at) AS Num_Completed_Tests
FROM complete_tests
GROUP BY Month;
#有时候alias（Month）不被识别，那么就重新写一遍 MONTH（created_at)

SELECT test_name, MONTH(created_at) AS Month, COUNT(created_at) AS Num_Completed_Tests
FROM complete_tests
GROUP BY test_name, Month
